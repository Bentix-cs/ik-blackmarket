# ik-blackmarket
## QBCore QB-Menu + QB-Input based black market script

Used the same logic as the qb-shops so the config is self explanatory.

- Easy to setup items
- Multiple blackmarkets supported
- Random or fixed locations (when random, location changes after each script restart)
- Multiple checks for inventory size and slot limits
